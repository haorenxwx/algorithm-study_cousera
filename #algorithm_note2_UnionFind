#algorithm_note2_UnionFind

## union fund
### dynamic connectivity
	problem:
	- union command:
	- find connected query of any 2 objects(if there is a path):
	
	modeling the objects:
	- pixels in a digital photo
	- computers in a network
	- transistors in a computer chip
	- ...
	
	modeling the connections
	- p is connected to q
	- connected components:
		{0}{1 4 5}{2 3 6 7}
		inside each set(component), objects are connected
	
	Implementing the operations
	- find query: check is 2 objects are in the same component
	- union command: replace components containing 2 objects with their union.

	Union-find data type(API)(design efficient data structure for union find)
	- Dynamic-connecttivity client
		. read in pair of integers form standard input
		. if not connected, connect them and print out pair

### quick find--using eager approach
	Data structure:
	- iterger array id[]
	- p and q are connected iff(if and only if) they have the same id.
		0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
	id[]0 1 1 8 8 0 0 1 8 8		---0,5,6 are connected

	Find
	check if p and q have the same id

	union
	to merge components containing p and q, change all the entries whose id equals id[p] to id[q]
		0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
	id[]0 1 1 8 8 0 0 1 8 8		---union 6 and 1
		0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
	id[]1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 8 8		---change the id[6] to the id[1]

			int pid = id[p];

	**quick find is too slow**
	Cost model: number of array accesses(for read or write)
	It is a quadratic algorithm, do not scale(large calculation)

### Quick union
	for large amount of data quick find is too slow
	Data structure:
	- Integer array id[] of size N
	- Interpretation: id[i] is parent(root) of i.
	
	Find: check if p and q have the same root

	Union:to merge components containing p and q
	- set the id of p's root to the id of q's root
	(change one number and merge 2 group)

	still too slow, trees can get tall, and find are experience
### Improvement 
#### weighted quick-union 
	- base on quick union, avoid tall tree
	- track the size of each tree(number of objects)
	- balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree.(use the root of large tree be the root of small tree)
	----no one is too far away from root.
	Data structure:
	same as quick-union, but maintain extra array sz[i]
	-count number of objects in the tree rooted at i
	Find: return root(p) == root(q)
	Union:
	- link root of smaller tree to root of larger tree
	- update the sz[] array
	'''
	int i = root(p)
	int j = root(q)

## step of developing a usable algorithm
	- model the problem
	- find an algrithm to solve
	- fast enough? fit in memory?
	- if not, figure out why
	- find a way to address the problem
	- iterate untill saticfied
