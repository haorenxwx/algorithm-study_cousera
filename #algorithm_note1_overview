#algorithm_note1_overview

##== cource overview ==
algotirhm: method of solving a problem
data structure: method of store information
part1:
- data types
- sorting
- searching
part2:
- graphs
- strings
- advanced

##== why study algorithms ==
using computational models replace math models
which is hard to create and test
